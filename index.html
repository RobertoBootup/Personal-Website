                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello! I'm Roberto, a pure mathematics student from Pittsburgh with a passion for programming. I think that businesses of all sizes are still massively underutilizing computer/data science applications, and I hope to one day make a career out of speeding up business processess with these electronic tools. </p>

            <h2>About This Site</h2>
            <div>
                <p>For one, I created this website (from scratch) to learn how to code in HTML/CSS, so that I can help anyone create or refine a website of their own. 
                    Secondly, this website will serve as a portfolio for the various projects that I'm embarking on, so that people can have an idea of what interests me and where I'd potentially enjoy professional work. I'd like to consider myself tech savvy, so if you're a small-medium sized business owner who feels that their workday could be optimized by computer science methods, feel free to reach out through my contact link.
